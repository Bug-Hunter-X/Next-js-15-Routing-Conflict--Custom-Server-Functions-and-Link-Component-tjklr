```javascript
import Link from 'next/link';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link href="/">
        <a>Home</a>
      </Link>
      <Link href="/about">
        <a>About</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
This code uses Next.js's Link component to create links to the home and about pages. However, if you have a custom server-side function that redirects based on the user's session or other factors, it might overwrite the route and cause unexpected behavior. The redirection might not work as expected, resulting in broken links. This happens because the custom server function may not be aware of the client-side routing done by Next.js's Link component.
